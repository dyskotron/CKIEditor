# CKIEditor
**Instrument Editor for Sequentix Cirklon hardware midi sequencer.**

Simple One-screen desktop editor where you can tweak all aspects of instrument definition - global params, note rows, CCs and Track values - without need to manualy edit .CKI files.

Editor supports all features of CirkOS v1.17

It is currently work in progress but everything except track values already seems to work correctly.
Last features being implemented before v1.0 Release are:

* TrackValues
* Better data error checking with user notifications
* More export options (export only selected instruments, choose target CirkOS version)
